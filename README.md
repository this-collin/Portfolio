A portfolio project.

I've refactored the code to meet my needs and added a few features.

The initial project was created/designed by https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio so thanks to him for the great work and allowing others to build off of this!

I will create my own portfolio from scratch in the future, but for now will be using this one, so stay tuned for my own coming soon....
